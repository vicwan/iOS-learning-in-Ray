/*:
## Challenge 1 - Building a Class Heirarchy
Create a class named `Animal` that has…
1. a function named `speak()` that does nothing.
 
Create two `Animal` subclasses...
1. `WildAnimal` that...
  - has an `isPoisonous` property, that is a `Bool`
  - has an initializer that takes `isPoisonous` as a parameter
2. `Pet` that...
  - has a stored property named `name`, that is a `String`
  - has an initializer that takes `name` as a parameter
  - has a `play()` method that prints out a message
  - overrides `speak()` - It should print out a message

Create one subclass of your choice of `WildAnimal` or `Pet`. It should do at least one of the following:
 - override `speak()`
 - override `play()`
 - Add a new computed property
 - Add a new method

/*:
## Challenge 2 - Casting
- Create at least one instance of each class from the first challenge.
- Create an array that contains all of the instances.
- Write a function that takes an `Animal` and does something different depending on what subclass it is. Try using conditional downcasting!
- Call the function with each of your instances using a loop or whatever other method you'd like!
